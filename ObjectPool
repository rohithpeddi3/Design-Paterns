OBJECT POOL:
Reuse and share objects that are expensive to create 

Reusable- Wraps the limited resource,will be shared by many for a limited amount of time
Client- uses an instance of type reusable
ReusablePool- creating and managing a pool of ojects [Singleton object]

Typical flow of operations:
--> Request for a reusable object [by client to pool]
--> If found return it else create a new one and return it 
--> If unable to create a new one, wait until one is released

Problems:
> Limited number of resources in the pool
> Handling situations when creating a new resource fails
> Synchronization
> Expired resources[unused but still reserved]

Objects are to be marked available after they are released so that 
pool can re use it accordingly
